# Lapor Aman - Blueprint

## Overview

Lapor Aman is a web application designed to provide a safe and anonymous platform for reporting bullying incidents. It aims to empower victims and witnesses to speak up without fear of retaliation, ensuring that every case is handled with the seriousness it deserves.

## Implemented Features

### Design and Layout
- **Color Palette:** The application uses a calming and trustworthy color scheme with Light Blue (`bg-blue-100`) as the primary background color and a vibrant Orange (`bg-orange-500`) for accents and calls-to-action.
- **Typography:** Clear and legible fonts are used to ensure readability and accessibility for all users.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
- **Header:** A consistent header with the "LAPOR AMAN" logo and an "Admin Login" button is used across the main pages.

### Pages
- **Home (`/`):** 
  - A welcoming hero section with the message "Layanan Aspirasi & Pengaduan Online Rakyat" and a main heading "Jangan Takut, Lapor Sekarang!".
  - A prominent "LAPOR SEKARANG" button that directs users to the report form.
  - Three feature cards with icons: "Tulis Laporan", "Proses Verifikasi", and "Tindak Lanjut".
  - An "Alur Laporan" section explaining the reporting process.
- **Report Form (`/lapor`):** 
  - A comprehensive form titled "Buat Laporan" for submitting bullying reports.
  - Includes fields for "Jenis Kasus," "Lokasi Kejadian," "Deskripsi Detil," and an "Lapor Secara Anonim" checkbox.
  - A "Kirim Laporan" button to submit the form.
- **Admin Login (`/admin/login`):** 
  - A simple login form for administrators.
  - Includes fields for "Email" and "Kata Sandi."

## Current Plan

The current plan is to update the UI of the Home and Report Form pages to match the provided design. This includes creating a reusable Header component, redesigning the hero section and feature cards on the homepage, adding a new "Alur Laporan" section, and restyling the report form.
